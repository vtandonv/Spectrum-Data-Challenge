# Spectrum-Data-Challenge

We were given a database containing data from DotEcon’s Spectrum Award Database, on various spectrum allocations done worldwide from 1994 until 2020. For Australia's 3G and India's 3G spectrum data, we analyzed all the features, figured out the important features of a spectrum, and then visualized these features. After analyzing and visualizing these features by relating them, we tried to predict prices for the next year in case of India 3G Spectrum.

Due to copyright Issues the Dataset for this Project is not uploaded in this repository.
